First steps and best practices for getting a reproduceable environment for Django development!

Abstract
''''''''

Using Vagrant and Chef-solo to set up a Django development environment.

This will include: - Use Vagrant to create a re-usable virtual machine in which to run your application - Chef-solo to define the software running on the virtual machine and setting up the app. - Using pip and virtualenv to install Python and libraries in an isolated way. - All of this in a shareable Git repository, ready to use with other team members.

No more lame "it works for me" excuses.
